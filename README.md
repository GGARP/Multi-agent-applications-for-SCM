# Extending Multi-Agent Systems for Supply Chain Management
In this project, we extend the original experiments of the InvAgent study and introduce new frameworks designed to  enhance multi-agent inventory management applications. Leveraging LLM-based zero-shot learning along with self-messaging capabilities, our approach explores adaptive decision-making and compares it with the traditional frameworks. 
## Installation 

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/GGARP/Multi-agent-applications-for-SCM.git
cd InvAgent
```

2. Install the requirements.txt or requirements2.txt depending on the experiment

## Recreating the experiments 
- To run the experiments, use any of the Ipynb files, note that an OPENAI_API_KEY or DEEP_SEEK_API_KEY are required as an environment variable.
- Each folder contains env (for environment) and config (for environment configuration) files which are necessary for  working with notebook ipynb files
- Additionally, you can find the archive of all trained networks in the MAPPO folder
